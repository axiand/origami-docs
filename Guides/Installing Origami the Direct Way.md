# Installing Origami the Direct Way

## Setting up
Create a directory in your project folder - we'll name it `origami`.

## Cloning the repo
Clone the origami repo into the `origami` folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/axiand/origami.git
```

## Importing your copy of Origami
Assuming you did everything as this doc says, you can now import Origami as such.
```
const { Origami } = require('./origami/index.js')
```
