# Intro to Origami

## 1. What is Origami?
Origami is a flexible JavaScript framework that aims to simplify the process of building APIs. It provides abstractions for the most common tasks to help you get things done faster.

## 2. Setting up your Project
Create a folder anywhere you want - you can name it anything. This is where your project will live. 

This documentation will assume you are using Node.js + NPM, but we'll try to keep things tool-agnostic.

## 3. Install Origami
Open up your terminal of choice in the folder you just created, and install the `[--todo-publish-package--]` package.

For a typical Node + NPM setup, this would be:
```
npm i [--todo-publish-package--]
```
Wait for the package to install (shouldn't take too long), then continue following along!

If you'd rather do things the direct, dirty way, [this doc](../Guides/Installing%20Origami%20the%20Direct%20Way.md) should help.

## 4. Set up your project structure
Now it's time to actually get started. Note that for the sake of brevity, this documentation already assumes you have basic knowledge of how JavaScript works. If that's not something you have, please, find an awesome JavaScript tutorial, then feel free to come back when you're ready!

That being said, our project structure to begin with will be simple.

**Optional:**
You can initialize a package with NPM before proceeding. NPM will walk you through all the steps to initalize it.
```
npm init
```
